StarEightyTwo Aeon Machine Learning Predicting Building Water Consumption

[StarEightyTwo](https://www.stareightytwo.org) is a non-profit organization located in the Twin Cities that provides a service for non-profit and government agencies, and allows those interested in learning analytics through project-based work, by providing analytics services free of charge.


# What Is The Goal Of This Project?


This goal of this project was to assist Aeon, a local non-profit that provides housing to low-income families and individuals, to better predict overall water consumption in the buildings they manage.  The organization maintains a portfolio of 77 buildings, with a wide variety of attributes.  The organization pays for all utilities in the buildings they manage, and one of the challenges they face is occasional high water consumption.  They requested the organization attempt to develop one or more models that could be used to predict expected monthly water consumption, which would allow them to flag buildings having unexpected high consumption levels for investigation.
